1. The web-page fetch times for the larger router buffer is relatively much longer than the shorter router buffer.
This is because as the network link is being congested, since there is a bottleneck and a large buffer size,
the packets that are sent become queued for too long. Within a FIFO system, large buffers result in long queues,
and higher latency. A few packets being dropped and re-sent is much less overhead that a relatively large amount
of packets waiting in the buffer.

2. The maximum transmit queue length on the network interface reported in ifconfig is 1000 packets. If the queue drains
at 100 Mb/s, then if we assume that in the TCP layer, a packet is about 1500 bytes, then we can multiply 1000*1500 to
get 1,500,000‬ bytes, or 12,000,000 bits. The maximum time for a packet to leave the queue is the time for the 1000th
packet to leave the queue since it is a FIFO system. So we get 12,000,000 / 1e+8 bits/s = 0.12 seconds as the maximum
time that a packet would wait in the queue before it leaves the NIC.

3. RTT = RTTmin + Q/D
Where RTT = RTT varying by queue size, RTTmin is the minimum RTT in the network, Q is the size of the buffer queue,
and D is the rate of packet drain (e.g. 100Mb/s from Q2)

4. One way to mitigate the bufferbloat problem is evident in this mini-net testing which is to simply use smaller buffer
sizes. The other way would be to implement TCP congestion control which is host-based, feedback-based, and
window-based congestion control. Both of these things should significantly reduce the intensity of the congestion in a
network like the one in this scenario.
